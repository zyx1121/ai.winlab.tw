## Data Model

- **Announcement**: Global (`event_id IS NULL`) or event-scoped (`event_id IS NOT NULL`). Event-scoped announcements are excluded from the global `/announcement` page.
- **Result**: `type: personal | team`, optionally linked to an event via `event_id`. All results live under `/events/[slug]/results/[id]`; there is no global result listing page.
- **Recruitment** (DB table: `competitions`): Job postings are always event-scoped (`event_id IS NOT NULL`). Managed by admin or assigned vendors. There is no global recruitment page.
- **Event**: Container with `slug`, `pinned`, and `sort_order`. Pinned events appear directly in the header navigation.
- **EventVendor** (DB table: `event_vendors`): Links vendor-role users to events they can manage recruitment for.
- **RecruitmentInterest** (DB table: `recruitment_interests`): Tracks user interest in recruitment listings.

## Supabase Storage Setup (One-time)

All images are stored in the `announcement-images` bucket (public).

1. Supabase Dashboard → **Storage** → **New bucket**
   - Name: `announcement-images`
   - Public bucket: **ON**
2. Run `supabase/storage-policies.sql` in the **SQL Editor**

Image path prefixes by content type:

- Announcement inline images: root
- Result cover images: `results/`
- Recruitment images: `recruitment/`
- Organization member photos: `organization/`
- Event cover images: `events/`
